 # Stroke_Prediction

"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with a mortality rate of 5.5 million per year. Early identification of stroke warning signs is crucial for reducing its severity.
This study proposes various Machine learning which offer valuable insights into the potential for early stroke prediction.
Identifying stroke warning signs and employing predictive models can play a crucial role in reducing stroke severity and preventing up to 80% of cases, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention in stroke prevention strategies.
